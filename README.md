# Maestro

A one-click AI **video, image, and audio studio** for creators. Maestro pairs a modern React UI with a powerful generation backend and adds a **Director mode** that uses an LLM to plan music videos and short films from a single prompt. Optimized for the latest LTX-2.3 models & LoRAs, with support for virtually all open weight models.

## What it does

### 🎬 Director Mode — automatic music videos and short films
The flagship feature. Drop in an audio track or write a story; a local LLM plans every shot, writes screenplays/lyrics, generates start frames & keyframes with character consistency, polishes prompts per model & LoRA-specific prompting guides, and runs the full multi-clip generation. Two skills:

- **Music Video** — beat-aware shot planning aligned to your audio. The LLM analyzes BPM, sections (verse/chorus/bridge), and energy, then writes shots that hit the downbeats. Speaker transcription & diarization lets you name and target different voices or singers.
- **Short Film** — screenplay-driven scenes with named characters, dialogue, and continuity across cuts. Pacing-bias slider controls cut frequency.
  
- **Auto Mode** runs the entire pipeline end-to-end (analyze → plan → generate images → generate clips → combine). Manual mode lets you review and edit at every step.
- **Director v2 architecture** with structured shot planning, mode-specific prompt renderers, and a 3-pass refinement (screenplay → shot breakdown → per-model polish). Director v2 optimizes what the LLM is being asked to do across several passes, with each pass optimizing the LLM request for creativity (when writing the screenplay), structured outputs (when outputting JSON), and prompt refinement, which injects LoRA prompting guides into the context.  

### ⚡ Performance Auto-Tune — zero-config setup
Detects your GPU, VRAM, and RAM on first launch and picks the right profile, quantization, VAE tiling, and VRAM safety coefficient. No more "Profile 1 vs 2 vs 4.5" guesswork. Power users still have full manual control under "Show advanced settings."

- **OOM recovery banner** auto-suggests lowering the VRAM headroom when a generation runs out, with one-click apply.
- **Live preparation status** during model setup (for example, "Preparing transcription model on this host (downloads ~300MB if needed before loading)..." instead of a vague spinner).

### 🎨 Studio Mode — full manual control
Direct access to every model and every knob:
- **Video** — MiniMax H3 with native synchronized audio, LTX-2.3, Wan1/2, Hunyuan, and many more.
- **Image** — Flux 2 Klein 9B, Krea 2 RAW/Turbo and Identity Edit, Qwen Image Edit, and many more
- **Audio** — TTS: Kugelaudio, Qwen3 TTS. Music: ACE-Step. SFX: MMAudio
- **Multi-clip generation** with per-clip prompts, seamless overlapping (sliding window) transitions, and shared LoRAs
- **Blend video Mode** Remember Sora 1 blend mode, where you could overlap two videos, and use AI to blend them together? 
- **Frames Injection (KFI)** for character continuity in long videos
- **Sliding window** for arbitrarily long generations
- **Spatial upsampling, film grain, codec selection** as post-processing options

MiniMax H3 Studio accepts one coherent global prompt. Authored timestamps stay exact;
otherwise Maestro's deterministic planner maps the prompt onto legal native shots and can
choose unequal lengths from action and dialogue density. After exact physical geometry is
known, Maestro deterministically compiles sealed segment-local prompts without another LLM
call. Timed actions that cross a segment boundary receive explicit continuation slices, while
dialogue and final blocking retain one owner. Prompt Enhance remains optional and preserves
user-supplied timestamp tokens.

H3 uses server-authored performance profiles: **Draft** is managed four-step Turbo at
608x352, **Fast** is managed eight-step Turbo at 864x480, **Quality** and **High** are
20-step native profiles, and the named Delivery profiles disclose their native render and
upscale/crop path. Turbo is a pinned managed accelerator rather than a public LoRA or a
separate adjustable model surface. The server validates the exact model, assets, runtime,
and compatibility matrix and remains authoritative over stale client settings. Maestro does
not expose First Block Cache as a public H3 control.

The H3 visual-style workflow selector includes official MiniMax workflow identities such as
papercraft stop-motion, paper collage, product ads, music-video typography, and stylized 3D
shorts. Generate and Director send only an exact workflow ID; Maestro resolves its
revision-bound adapted brief server-side and compiles the guidance inside the legal H3 prompt
schema. Maestro checks the official H3 skills catalog daily, parses only bounded metadata
(never executes repository instructions), caches its revision and refresh status, and retains
an offline bundled catalog.

### 🤖 LLM Chat and prompting — built in
The **Chat** tab serves Maestro's local GGUF catalog to local and authorized
remote projects. Conversations stay in the browser and are separated by
project. An optional prompting-guide selector can add Maestro's H3 or other
model-specific guide when a conversation is ready to become a generation
prompt.

Maestro prepares `llama-server` and the selected GGUF on this host if needed;
allowed local and remote users reuse the shared host cache.
Linux NVIDIA systems build the pinned llama.cpp runtime with CUDA when a
compatible toolkit is available, probe the backend that actually loaded, and
fall back visibly to the official CPU runtime if acceleration is unavailable.
Launch settings are tuned per model and host; Chat shows the effective backend,
projector/vision capability, download state, and measured prompt/decode speed.

- Pre-curated registry: Gemma 4 (2B / 4B / 26B MoE / 31B) and Qwen3.6 27B — uncensored/abliterated instruct variants tuned for creative prompting
- **External providers** also supported: OpenAI, Anthropic, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints (currently experimental)
- **Vision Chat and enhancement** with up to four project-authorized images
  when the selected GGUF has a compatible MMPROJ/native vision path
- Local owners can select a strict Hugging Face model ID/URL and add read-only
  Linked Model Folders; remote users can use only the visible catalog and
  opaque discovered models, including automatic downloads
- Auto-unloads after 60s idle to free VRAM for video gen

### 🛒 Built-in CivitAI LoRA browser
- Search, filter, and one-click install any LoRA from CivitAI without leaving Maestro
- **LoRA update detection** — Check button refreshes from CivitAI, shows update badges on outdated LoRAs
- **My LoRAs view** with filters for Updates and direct uninstall
- **AI-generated LoRA prompting guides** Helps remove the guesswork from LoRAs. AI generates LoRA guides when LoRA is downloaded based on CIVITAI and HuggingFace repos. The guides explain what each LoRA does and how to use it, provide prompt examples, and recommend weight settings that are automatically applied when LoRA is selected. 
- **Recommended weight ranges** (sourced from CivitAI sidecars, HuggingFace, or fallback heuristics) shown directly on the weight sliders
- **Multi-LoRA pack auto-extraction** for archives that bundle several LoRAs

### 🎭 Themes
Three theme families, each with a dark and a light variant, switchable in Settings → System:
- **Golden Hour** (default) — warm cinematic palette with sunset-gradient CTAs and spotlight bezels; warm paper with burnt orange in daylight
- **Classic** — the original cool charcoal palette with blue accents; cool paper in daylight
- **Onyx** — minimalist monochrome, pure black with neutral grey surfaces; white and grey in daylight

Appearance mode is **Dark / Light / Auto** — Auto follows your system's appearance and switches live when it changes.

### 🛠️ Edit Mode
- **Retake** — re-roll a section of an existing video with a new prompt
- **Edit Anything** — modify, add, or remove elements from existing videos using text prompts and In-Context LoRA models
- **Outpaint** — extend a video's frame in any direction while preserving its original action, timing, and audio
- **Repaint** — use SCAIL-2 to repaint characters, objects, or scenes while retaining the source motion and camera work
- **Recast** — map one or more people in a video to replacement characters, including multi-shot scenes and group shots

### 📂 Workspaces
Multiple isolated output directories with a quick switcher in the sidebar. Useful for separating client projects, NSFW vs SFW, or experiments. Pinned and favorited outputs are tracked per workspace.

- Cloudflare access is enabled by default. After account migration is active, signed-in members see only projects granted to their Maestro account; counts, prompts, assets, jobs, and media stay hidden from nonmembers.
- Remote visitors cannot change machine settings, start/stop services, browse storage/model folders, or import arbitrary Hugging Face/CivitAI URLs. Curated model weights may still download when their generation needs them.
- After unlocking a project, remote visitors can browse and apply Maestro's bundled Recipes in Generate. Host-global user recipes are never listed remotely; saving, importing, deleting, and installing recipe LoRAs remain local host-owner actions.
- Project passwords are retained only for the bounded accounts-off or pre-migration compatibility path. Active account-migrated projects use sealed membership instead.
- **Reference** is a persistent sidebar peer to Generate and Director. Its create/manage workspace stays mounted while inactive so authored state survives navigation; Queue leaves Reference only after the submission and job reconnect are durably confirmed. Locked projects disable entry, and a newly locked active project returns to the prior workspace after clearing private Reference state.
- Reference makes reusable character, setting, item, and style cards, generates multiple candidates, and lets you keep/reject/delete variants before using them in Director or Generate semantic-reference workflows. The catalog includes explicit Moody Krea 2 quick-select cards when a recipe is enabled and present; disabled, missing, and manual-install states remain visible and are never auto-enabled or auto-selected.
- Gallery selection supports bulk move, privacy, and deletion. Finals are shown by default; All, Components, Windows, and Temporary views expose intermediate artifacts when needed. Deleting a final can atomically include its linked parts.
- Read-only single-output share links work for local owners and through the same Cloudflare URL, and are revoked when the output is moved, changed, deleted, or its project is removed.

### 🧭 Generation queue

The Queue is separate from the Gallery and opens after submission by default (configurable
in Advanced). Queue rows remain owner-only. Waiting positions count only positionable work:
first place reads “Next in line,” while later places state how many jobs are ahead. Cards include
the prompt preview, current segment/window versus overall progress, checkpoint/transition plan,
failure details, a bounded event log, and ETA for the owner's running job. Queued work can be
held and resumed.

### 🧊 Blender Motion Video

Blender Motion Video is a first-class Reference creation method as well as an existing Tools surface. It creates primitives/materials, animates the full requested frame range, inspects and previews the scene, and can Keep the rendered motion/camera guide as a protected project candidate for Generate control. The method stays orthogonal to durable semantic asset types and uses its own reference-name/privacy contract; the image-pack description remains on the authored pack. Pinokio installs a pinned portable Blender runtime plus the official Blender Lab MCP extension, then starts its localhost-only bridge with Maestro. Remote project users can invoke the same hosted tool through Maestro's project-scoped API; they never receive filesystem or machine-control access. Maestro never exposes the upstream arbitrary-Python surface.

### 🔒 Explicit guidance + experimental gate
- **Explicit prompt guidance** is an opt-in authoring aid with a disclaimer step. It never hides models, LoRAs, recipes, prompts, or locally processed outputs, and it does not moderate local content.
- **Experimental features gate** hides power-user toggles (external API keys, Voice Reference, Inpaint, Restyle, Wan2GP Enhancer) by default for a focused first-launch experience.

### 📊 Director Pipeline Dashboard
View all past Director runs with their full state — clip plans, generated images, generated clips, polish diffs. Re-run any clip without re-running the whole pipeline.

## Updates

Maestro Continuum has its own product release version, separate from the bundled Maestro-base compatibility version. This build is Continuum 0.3.0 on Maestro base 1.6.5; open **What's new** in the product header for Continuum notes and both release archives. The entries below record Maestro-base updates and are not Continuum release history. To update, use the launcher's Update button in Pinokio.

### v1.6.5 (2026-08-08)

**MiniMax H3 performance and lower-VRAM support**
- Added server-authored H3 performance bundles: Draft uses managed four-step Turbo at 608x352, Fast uses managed eight-step Turbo at 864x480, and Quality/High provide 20-step native generation.
- Added explicit 1080p, Ultra, and 4K Delivery profiles that distinguish native inference from learned upscale, crop, and downsample work.
- Turbo is now a pinned managed accelerator, not a selectable model or public LoRA. Its exact assets, runtime, model compatibility, and 4/8-step policy are server-authorized and cannot be replaced by client settings.
- Reworked H3 model residency, activation chunking, and VRAM budgeting to reduce step-zero out-of-memory failures and excessive CPU offloading.
- H3 has no public First Block Cache control; acceleration is expressed only through the validated profile surface.

**H3 resolutions and long-video planning**
- Generate and Director keep one coherent global H3 prompt instead of asking an LLM to write a separate prompt for every continuation window.
- Authored timestamps are authoritative; untimed prompts use a deterministic native-shot planner that can choose unequal shot lengths from action/dialogue density.
- The resulting native-shot plan persists the user's global prompt as immutable provenance and seals deterministic segment-local execution prompts. Boundary-spanning timed actions use explicit continuation slices; dialogue and final blocking remain single-owner.

**Director H3 workflow improvements**
- Director now uses the same server-authored H3 profiles and deterministic native-shot planner as Studio.
- Long scenes are divided into legal native shots before generation instead of being silently shortened at runtime.
- Improved independent-shot context so recurring characters, wardrobe, locations, blocking, dialogue, and sound remain self-contained across prompt-only H3 shots.

**MiniMax LoRA discovery and compatibility**
- Added a MiniMax H3 filter to the CivitAI browser and routed downloaded H3 LoRAs into the correct shared H3 folder.
- Pasted Hugging Face MiniMax H3 LoRA URLs now use the same correct destination instead of defaulting to LTX.
- Kept user-selected H3 LoRAs separate from the managed Turbo bundle so ordinary LoRA discovery cannot override its pinned compatibility policy.
- Added early server validation and pinned support assets for every managed Turbo profile.

### v1.6.1 (2026-08-06)

> Historical release note: the Full-model-only, six-step, adjustable Turbo-LoRA
> surface below was superseded by v1.6.5's server-managed Draft/Fast 4/8-step
> profiles. It is retained to document what v1.6.1 shipped.

**MiniMax H3 Turbo mode**
- Added the H3 Turbo LoRA to the Full H3 model lists as a managed, first-use download.
- Added an experimental one-click Turbo mode for Full First & Last and Full Omni models.
- Turbo mode uses six inference steps and starts at LoRA strength 0.70.
- The active Turbo LoRA is shown in Advanced settings so its strength can be tuned per generation.
- User-adjusted Turbo strengths are preserved while duplicate Turbo adapters and incompatible Pruned-model combinations remain blocked.

### v1.6.0 (2026-08-06)

> Historical release note: the Full/Pruned selectors and adjustable Turbo
> behavior below predate and are superseded by v1.6.5's curated H3 model and
> performance-profile contract.

**MiniMax H3 Omni Reference**
- Added MiniMax H3 Omni for generating new video and synchronized audio from ordered image, video, voice, motion, and sound references.
- References can be reordered, labeled with their intended role, and used for identity, appearance, scene, motion, voice, performance, ambience, or music conditioning.
- Added both recommended Pruned 20B and optional Full 33B Omni models.
- Added Match Output reference preparation for consumer GPUs and an optional Maximum Detail mode for higher-memory systems.
- Improved reference-video memory use with output-aware sizing, chunked projections, dedicated attention workspace, and safer model re-profiling.

**Expanded H3 models and performance options**
- Simplified the model choices to First & Last and Omni, with clear Pruned 20B and Full 33B variants and concise explanations in the selector.
- Added Full 33B support for both workflows, including ConvRot checkpoint loading, fused projection handling, and memory-efficient streaming.
- Added selectable NVFP4-AWQ, GGUF Q2/Q4, Quanto INT8, and BF16 Qwen3-VL text encoders with hardware-aware recommendations.
- Added support for the MiniMax H3 Turbo LoRA on compatible Full 33B models with true 4, 6, and 8-evaluation schedules.
- Incompatible Turbo LoRA and Pruned-model combinations are rejected before loading instead of failing after a long generation.

**H3 Studio workflow and prompting**
- Omni generations are limited to the native 345-frame maximum: 14.375 seconds at 24 FPS, displayed as 14.4 seconds, with sliding-window controls automatically hidden.
- First & Last uses the same native 14.4-second maximum per window and can now generate longer videos by continuing each window from the preceding final frame.
- Long First & Last runs preserve the requested duration, remove continuation overlap, keep synchronized audio aligned, and apply an optional end image only to the final window.
- Fixed portrait and other selected aspect ratios being forced or decoded as 16:9.
- Improved H3 Prompt Enhance for exact dialogue retention, stable speaker IDs, voice-reference intent, opening ambience, silent intervals, and reduced gibberish or invented speech.

**MiniMax H3 in Director**
- Added model-aware Director workflows for both First & Last and Omni models.
- First & Last can create prompt-only shots or use optional generated start/end frames, while Omni can condition shots on character, location, voice, video, soundtrack, and other project references.
- Director no longer spends time writing or generating unused start images for H3 prompt-only workflows.
- H3 shot prompts now carry the project world, location, wardrobe, character blocking, screen position, dialogue, soundscape, and continuity needed by independently generated clips.
- Added stable project-wide speaker mapping, locked screenplay dialogue, duration-aware pacing, and multi-speaker exchanges with camera changes inside a single H3 clip.
- Incomplete or altered local-LLM shot plans are repaired deterministically without silently truncating, moving, duplicating, or rewriting approved dialogue.
- Dashboard repair and regeneration recreate the same H3 references and timing, including exact per-shot audio conditioning and one clean final soundtrack.

**Compatibility and reliability**
- Director model lists now show only image and video models that support the selected automated workflow.
- Native audio generation is distinguished from audio-reference input so incompatible models are no longer offered for audio-driven jobs.
- Reduced console noise by hiding successful system-stat polling while retaining failures and meaningful API requests.
- Interrupted saved Director jobs are now reported as interrupted instead of disappearing as missing projects.
- Expanded automated coverage for H3 checkpoints, quantization, Omni reference packing, Turbo LoRA, Studio continuation, Director compatibility, dialogue planning, memory behavior, and UI contracts.

### v1.5.5 (2026-08-04)

**MiniMax H3 local audio-video generation**
- Added native local MiniMax H3 Base FL2VA support with text-to-video, image-to-video, and first/last-frame video generation.
- H3 generates synchronized 32 kHz stereo audio together with the video instead of requiring a separate audio pass.
- Added approximately 5-15 second generation at 24 FPS with landscape, portrait, square, native 768p, and lower-VRAM resolution options.
- Added automatic, revision-pinned provisioning for the compact scaled-FP8 transformer, NVFP4 Qwen3-VL conditioner, video VAE, audio VAE, tokenizer, and processor assets.
- The current integration includes non-distilled Base FL2VA and Ref2VA, explicit-mode PinkCherry FL2VA, and an experimental Kijai W4A8 Base-FL2VA option. Ref2VA accepts semantic image/video/audio references; FL2VA owns text, first-frame, and first/last-frame segments. Hosted 2K regeneration remains outside this integration.
- H3's curated default is Quality with Sol-Attn; Ultra uses exact dense SDPA. On the release-bound Linux CUDA 12.8/SM120 runtime, Draft at 608x352 and Fast at 864x480 use the pinned official SageAttention2++ v2.2.0 source build after exact Base kernel, visual, and audio gates passed. Fast's SDPA comparison loaded the model cold, so the record preserves that wall time without presenting it as a speed claim. Explicit Sage requests remain fail-closed, and W4A8, PinkCherry, and Ref2VA remain unvalidated and excluded from Sage profiles.

**H3 prompting and dialogue**
- Added an H3-specific Context-IR Prompt Enhance workflow using the model's native multimodal description, soundscape, music, speaker-ID, and dialogue-tag structure.
- Vague requests such as two characters discussing a subject can now be expanded into concise, meaningful dialogue sized to the selected duration.
- User-supplied dialogue is preserved verbatim, and remaining time is assigned to silent visible action to reduce invented speech and gibberish.
- Start-frame prompts now receive the correct H3 image-alignment instruction while raw prompting remains available by simply not using Prompt Enhance.
- H3 enhancement bypasses the incompatible generic cinematic enhancer and remains one native timeline instead of being divided into false sliding-window paragraphs.

**H3 compatibility, memory, and reliability**
- Corrected compact Qwen3-VL prompt conditioning so H3 follows the requested subject instead of producing unrelated repeated scenes.
- Added native row-scaled INT8 embedding support and corrected NVFP4 pre-quantization and combined-scale handling for Comfy-format checkpoints.
- Fixed mixed-dtype model profiling, keyframe CPU/CUDA device mismatches, and first-frame generation failures.
- Added activation chunking, explicit transformer working-memory reservation, and MMGP-friendly dtype locks so H3 can stream on consumer GPUs without starving the first denoising step.
- Added regression coverage for prompt conditioning, quantized checkpoint loading, keyframes, scheduler behavior, audio output, activation chunking, and H3 prompt structure.

**Multi-character Recast continuity**
- Improved SCAIL-2 Recast when a mapped character enters later within an otherwise continuous camera shot.
- Added hidden identity pre-roll conditioning so late-arriving characters can be introduced without publishing an artificial visible cut.
- Recast assembly now validates that all generated segments are present and that the final output retains the exact source timeline length.

### v1.5.0 (2026-08-02)

**SCAIL-2 Recast and multi-character replacement**
- Rebuilt Recast around SCAIL-2's native replacement conditioning for substantially stronger identity transfer and motion tracking.
- Added color-mapped character cards for replacing up to five people in one run.
- Added camera-shot detection and per-shot processing so characters remain correctly mapped when a video cuts between close-ups, wide shots, and group shots.
- Improved two-person and multi-person shots by conditioning each shot only on the characters visible in it.
- Added automatic reacquisition when a person first appears later, leaves the frame, or returns after a camera cut.
- Other people in the scene are now preserved automatically when bystanders are detected.
- References are automatically isolated from their backgrounds, aligned to the target, and supplemented with a face-detail view when useful.
- Added optional lighting and shadow matching using Z.ai's official SCAIL-2 Relighting LoRA, downloaded, verified, and converted automatically when needed on the host.
- Added 480p, 512p, and 704p quality profiles with VRAM-aware window sizing; model steps remain independently adjustable.
- Fixed reference-image backgrounds, white bars, halos, false gray scenes, blurry identity starts, and reference stills appearing at the beginning of output videos.
- Fixed mismatched reference and control-video aspect ratios causing tensor errors or allowing the character image to control the output canvas.

**SCAIL-2 Repaint**
- Added Repaint as a first-class Edit mode for changing characters, objects, or the visual treatment of a video while retaining its motion and camera path.
- Repaint detects camera cuts, processes each shot independently, and rejoins the exact source timeline with one continuous audio track.
- Added multi-region and multi-character mapping with stable colors across shots.
- Repaint now shares Recast's 480p, 512p, and 704p resolution profiles and adaptive VRAM windows.
- Wired inference steps and applicable guidance controls to the generation pipeline while hiding advanced settings SCAIL-2 does not use.
- Simplified the Repaint and Recast interfaces, moved detailed guidance into tooltips, and ordered Edit modes as Retake, Edit Anything, Outpaint, Repaint, and Recast.

**LTX-2.3 Outpaint and Retake**
- Rebuilt Outpaint around LTX-2.3's official In/Outpainting IC-LoRA workflow with mask-preserving source conditioning.
- Added shot-aware Outpaint: multi-scene videos are split at camera cuts, processed independently, and reassembled at the exact original frame count with the source audio restored.
- Improved seams, detail, color-temperature matching, and removal of green/yellow marker spill without grading the protected source region.
- Source pixels remain protected while the full source frame stays available as visual context for newly generated areas.
- Output canvas dimensions now follow the selected quality preset and display the actual aligned pixel size before generation.
- Fixed Outpaint ignoring visible inference-step settings, using invalid schedules, or failing immediately on supported LTX models.
- Fixed Retake failing on LTX-2.3 distilled and two-stage pipelines.

**Krea 2 image generation and editing**
- Added Krea 2 RAW Identity Edit and Krea 2 Turbo Identity Edit using the current Krea 2 vision-conditioning pipeline and Identity Edit v1.2 LoRA.
- Added identity-preserving instruction edits, inpainting, outpainting, background removal, and support for up to two total reference images.
- Added automatic Qwen3-VL vision-encoder provisioning and accurate installed/readiness checks.
- Added compatibility with current Diffusers, Kohya, and GGUF Krea 2 weight formats.
- Added a dedicated Krea 2 filter to the CivitAI browser and My LoRAs view, with downloads routed to the correct Krea 2 library.
- Krea 2 RAW, Turbo, RAW Identity Edit, and Turbo Identity Edit are now enabled by default in Image mode for new and existing installations.

**Studio, models, and control video**
- Enabled-model choices now persist server-side across Maestro restarts and changing Pinokio ports.
- Newly downloaded CivitAI checkpoints appear in model selectors immediately without restarting Maestro.
- Control video and audio behavior are now independent in Frames mode: keep source audio, generate audio from the prompt, or use an uploaded soundtrack.
- Missing Temporal Depth assets for LTX control-video workflows are downloaded with progress, resume support, hash verification, and atomic installation.
- Voice Reference is now a standard feature, enabled by default and no longer hidden behind the in-development feature switch.
- Cleaned up Recast and Repaint Advanced Settings so only controls used by the selected SCAIL-2 pipeline are shown.

**Reliability and fixes**
- Director no longer creates a duplicate combined file when a run contains only one finished clip.
- Fixed SCAIL-2 relighting and user LoRAs failing validation when stale multi-phase weights were present.
- Fixed installed Maestro apps being hidden or blocked by an early Pinokio NVIDIA detection failure.
- Added broad regression coverage for SCAIL-2, Repaint, Outpaint, Retake, model visibility, temporal-depth downloads, and Krea 2 editing.

### v1.4 (2026-07-20)

**Storage and space optimization**
- Added a full Storage Manager with usage analytics and cleanup recommendations.
- Added safe deletion for workspaces, saved Director projects, models, and LoRAs.
- Added duplicate model and LoRA detection across linked installations.
- Added safe duplicate reclamation while preserving a verified copy.
- Added optional removal from linked installations through the Windows Recycle Bin.
- Improved storage accounting for shared weights, linked folders, junctions, symlinks, and hardlinks.

**LoRA management**
- Added LoRA file sizes, release dates, download dates, and compact age indicators.
- Added sorting by name, newest download, newest release, or file size.
- Added newest-first sorting to the Studio and Director LoRA selectors.
- Improved explanations for shared-weight, linked-only, and otherwise protected files.
- Added CivitAI response caching for faster browsing and fewer rate-limit problems.

**Director Dashboard and repair**
- Added a durable Check + Repair workflow for saved Director projects.
- Repair can regenerate missing images and videos, skip valid clips, and automatically rejoin the result.
- Repair continues when the browser is refreshed or closed.
- Interrupted repairs can be resumed without repeating completed clips.
- Fixed repair stopping after generating only one image or video.
- Fixed missing thumbnails, incorrect missing-clip counts, and incomplete clip tracking.
- Regenerating a start image now correctly marks its existing video for regeneration.
- Rejoin now rejects missing, invalid, or stale clips instead of creating an incomplete video.
- Dashboard operations now remain responsive while regeneration or repair runs in the background.

**Director character consistency**
- Director now generates an establishing character image when no reference image is supplied.
- The generated image becomes the shared reference for all subsequent start images.
- Character references and profiles are incorporated into the generated anchor.
- Generated start images are now correctly supplied to their corresponding video clips.
- The generated reference is retained for later Dashboard regeneration.

**Music-video timing and lip sync**
- Fixed Dashboard-regenerated clips becoming shorter than their original timeline slots.
- Regenerated clips now use the same FPS and frame schedule as a complete Director run.
- Fixed cumulative lip-sync drift after replacing one or more clips.
- Fixed rejoined videos using the wrong starting point in the source song.
- Rejoined videos continue to use one clean, continuous soundtrack without audible clip-boundary blips.
- Dashboard audio conditioning now matches the exact timeline segment assigned to each clip.

**Job cancellation and reliability**
- Significantly improved Stop and Cancel behavior across Director and Studio.
- Queued and actively generating child jobs are now canceled together.
- Late completion or failure can no longer overwrite a canceled job.
- Improved timeout handling and cleanup of partial outputs.
- Made Director state saving atomic to prevent damaged project files.
- Prevented delete, resume, repair, and regeneration operations from conflicting with one another.

**Downloads and model installation**
- Added clearer model and LoRA download progress, completion, failure, and retry states.
- Fixed inaccurate download percentages.
- Prevented concurrent downloads from writing to the same destination.
- Incomplete or corrupted downloads are no longer published as installed models.
- Hardened CivitAI archive extraction against unsafe paths and invalid files.
- Improved cleanup of failed and interrupted downloads.

**Safety, compatibility, and stability**
- Fixed sidebar crashes when changing models or generation modes.
- Improved NVIDIA GPU compatibility checks during Pinokio installation.
- Expanded automated regression testing for both dev and main.

### v1.3.3 (2026-07-17)

**Fixed**
- **Recast no longer crashes when the person leaves the scene.** If the target walked out of frame partway through the clip (or only appeared later in the video), the tracking step died with a cryptic "No points are provided" error and took the whole job with it. Tracking now locks on wherever the person first appears, works in both directions from there, and if it loses them mid-video it keeps everything tracked so far and picks them back up when they return. Frames where the person genuinely is not present simply keep the original footage, which is what replace mode should do. Both underlying bugs exist in upstream WanGP too; a keyword that matches nothing in the video now shows the friendly "could not find" message instead of a traceback.

### v1.3.2 (2026-07-17)

**New**
- **Models can be downloaded ahead of time.** In Settings -> System -> Enabled Models, the download icon next to each model is now a real button: click it and Maestro fetches everything that model needs (weights, text encoder, add-on modules, bundled LoRAs) in the background, with progress in the download banner. The row flips to a check mark when it finishes. Generating still downloads missing files to the shared host cache when needed; this just lets you get the wait out of the way on your schedule.

**Fixed**
- **Recast no longer crashes on a fresh install.** The automatic masking step runs before the SCAIL-2 model loads, but its detector checkpoint only downloaded together with the model, so the very first Recast on a clean install failed with "SAM3.1 checkpoint was not found". The masking step now downloads the detector itself when it is missing from the host cache.
- **The downloaded check marks tell the truth now.** Models that borrow their weights from a base model (SCAIL-2 14B Fast, the Z-Image ControlNets) always showed as not downloaded, even when they were ready to run. The check now follows those references and also requires add-on modules and bundled accelerator LoRAs, so a check mark means the model generates without downloading anything.
- Deleting a model now removes only the files that belong to it, so deleting a finetune leaves shared base weights in place for the models that still use them.
- SCAIL-2's image reference no longer fails when the detection phrase finds nothing in your character image; Maestro automatically falls back to broader phrases ("person", "woman", "man").

### v1.3.1 (2026-07-17)

**Fixed**
- **Model downloads no longer fail when your saved Hugging Face token has gone stale.** A stale or expired token made Hugging Face reject even public files with a misleading "Repository Not Found" (reported as the SCAIL-2 download failing, issue #20). Maestro now detects the rejection and retries the download anonymously, which covers everything Maestro ships. Valid tokens are still used first, so gated models keep working.
- Recast's Advanced Settings no longer show resolution and window controls that the generation ignores (Recast runs at SCAIL-2's native 480p with its 81-frame windows).

### v1.3.0 (2026-07-17)

**New: SCAIL-2 character animation.** Z.ai's follow-up to SCAIL Preview, integrated end to end. It transfers a performance from any video onto any character with no skeleton extraction, and it comes in two flavors: **SCAIL-2 14B** (the full native 40-step model) and **SCAIL-2 14B Fast** (bundled lightx2v distill, 6 steps, and no CFG for rapid animation). Fast is the recommended starting point for Recast, though results can vary by seed. Both are enabled by default. This host may need to download about 16.6 GB, plus a small detector model.

- **Animate (Video tab).** Pick SCAIL-2 in Frames mode, drop a character image as the Start Image and a performance clip on the new Control Video tile, generate. The character performs the clip's motion in their own scene. Output follows the source clip's frame rate (capped at 30fps) and keeps its audio.
- **Recast (Edit tab).** The headline: replace a person in an existing video with your character. Drop a video, type who to replace ("woman", "man in red"), preview the selection with the eye button, drop the character image, generate. Masking is fully automatic (SAM3 keyword tracking), and the scene, camera, and audio are preserved. The prompt is optional; describing the new character helps identity.
- **Use current frame as reference.** Gallery videos now have the same left-arrow button images have: scrub the preview to the moment you want and click to send that exact frame to the Reference tiles, which is the perfect way to pick a character out of an existing clip for Recast.

**Fixed**
- Sliding-window, frame-rate, and audio defaults now reach generations reliably (previously a 10s SCAIL-2 run could go out as one giant window and overflow VRAM, render at 16fps instead of the source rate, or come back silent).
- SCAIL-2's VRAM budget now accounts for its in-context conditioning (it carries the driving video as extra tokens), so 480p multi-window runs fit a 24 GB card with room to spare instead of spilling into system memory.
- "10 seconds" now means 10 seconds of your source clip regardless of its frame rate, and 60fps sources no longer double the generation work.
- Queued Recasts wait their turn for the GPU instead of running their detection passes on top of the active generation.

### v1.2.8 (2026-07-16)

**Fixed**
- **Linked LoRAs now show up in My LoRAs.** The library view only listed Maestro's own loras folder, even though guide generation and the Studio selectors already saw LoRAs from Linked Model Folders. My LoRAs now lists them too — with their names, previews, and generated guides — and marks them with a "Linked" badge so you can tell which library each one comes from.

### v1.2.7 (2026-07-16)

**Fixed**
- **LTX generation crash ("TypeError: not a string") on Linked Model Folder installs** — the follow-up to v1.2.6's text-encoder fix. That fix created Maestro's own Gemma folder to hold the downloaded weight, but the folder then hid the linked install's complete folder that has the tokenizer files, and the tokenizer loader crashed. Maestro now completes its own folder with the missing tokenizer files automatically (about 40 MB, once), and folder lookups skip folders that don't actually contain what's being looked for. Affected installs heal themselves on the next generation.

### v1.2.6 (2026-07-16)

**Fixed**
- **Endless re-downloading of text encoder models (Gemma, Qwen) on installs using Linked Model Folders.** When the text encoder's target folder didn't exist yet, the downloaded weight was silently renamed to the folder's own name instead of being placed inside it, so Maestro could never find it: every generation re-downloaded the full 13 GB and then crashed with "Loading Text Encoder 'None'". This only happened when a linked install (like an existing Wan2GP) already provided the folder's tokenizer files, which skipped the step that normally creates the folder. The fix also removes the misnamed leftover file automatically, so affected installs heal themselves on the next generation — just update and generate.

### v1.2.5 (2026-07-16)

**Fixed**
- **Black screen on launch for some Windows machines.** The UI's JavaScript was being served with a wrong MIME type on machines where a registry entry was hijacked (Python reads MIME types from the Windows registry), and browsers silently refuse to run module scripts served that way. Maestro now forces the correct types server-side no matter what the registry says. If the UI ever fails to start for any other reason, the black screen is replaced after 10 seconds with a diagnostic page listing recovery steps instead of leaving you guessing.
- The Classic UI link printed at startup was missing its trailing slash and returned a 404. Both the link and the bare /classic path work now.

### v1.2.4 (2026-07-15)

**Fixed**
- **Director now truly holds a stylized reference's art style.** Telling the image model to "preserve the art style" at the end of a prompt does nothing; what works is naming the medium at the very start. Director now looks at your reference once per run, names its style concretely ("black and white cartoon illustration"), and automatically leads every image prompt with "Maintain the same ... art style." Photographic references skip the prefix. Applies to start images, keyframes, the establishing shot, and per-clip reruns.
- Motion-blur and speed-line requests are stripped from start-frame prompts. The planner's music-video energy language was leaking into still images and the image model obliged with smeared backgrounds; start frames are now always sharp and motion stays in the video prompt where it belongs.
- The main performer is now anchored to the reference image in image prompts ("the singer from the reference image") instead of being described loosely, which made the image model invent a new character design for the star while giving the reference's look to background characters.

### v1.2.3 (2026-07-15)

**Added**
- **Uploads view in the workspace switcher.** Browse every image and video you've uploaded (start frames, reference photos) and send them straight back into the pipeline with the "use as input" arrow. Browse-only: generations keep saving to your real workspace.
- **Manual model unload.** A small power button in the System panel (bottom left, expanded view) unloads the resident generation model and LLM to free VRAM and RAM, with an inline confirm. Models still stay loaded between generations by default so retries start instantly.
- **Collapsible model families.** In Settings > Enabled Models, each family (Wan 2.1, Hunyuan, Flux 1, ...) can be collapsed — and stays collapsed across sessions — with a checkbox to enable or disable the whole family at once.

**Fixed**
- Director Stop now aborts the clip being generated within seconds. It used to only take effect between clips, so the current clip kept rendering (10+ minutes of GPU work on slower cards) and a stopped run could even be marked "completed". Finished clips are kept for the Dashboard.
- The Director text entry box grows upward as you type (up to ~11 lines) instead of staying two lines tall, and its scrollbar is actually visible.
- Director mode keeps the art style of your reference images. Hand-drawn, anime, watercolor and other stylized references now carry their medium into every image prompt instead of coming out photorealistic.
- Director no longer sneaks subjects from its internal instruction examples into your video (the recurring dragon), and a location you specify in your description is now binding — shot variety comes from camera angles, not invented places.
- Speaker identification during song analysis now actually runs. It was silently skipped on every install (the model never downloaded without a HuggingFace token); the checkpoints (~30 MB) now download automatically from an ungated mirror when missing from the host cache. Its clustering is also tuned for singing now: a solo vocalist reads as one speaker and duets as two, instead of one singer splitting into six.
- The Load Settings pencil on songs restores everything: the Style / Music Caption (works retroactively on existing songs), the "Describe your song" text and Instrumental toggle (new songs), and it switches to the right Audio sub-tab — Speech, Music, or SFX — instead of leaving whichever was last open.

**Changed**
- A page refresh now starts clean: prompt fields empty, seed back to random, no LoRAs selected, and Advanced settings at the model's recommended defaults. Your mode, model selections, enabled models, and theme still persist, and switching between modes within a session still carries your work back and forth. (This reverses v1.2.0's restore-on-refresh behavior — stale text and seeds reappearing after a reload felt wrong.)

### v1.2.2 (2026-07-14)

**Fixed**
- Director Mode could get stuck at "Analyzing" forever after v1.2.0 on cards with less VRAM. Analysis runs right after the song renders, and the new default music model is much larger than the old one; on smaller GPUs the leftover model plus the vocal separator and Whisper overflowed VRAM, which Windows silently turns into an extreme slowdown instead of an error. The song model's VRAM is now released before analysis starts.
- Added an int8 version of the ACE-Step XL SFT transformer (5.5 GB instead of 10 GB). Cards using int8 quantization (what Auto-Tune selects below 24 GB) now download and load the smaller file automatically.

### v1.2.1 (2026-07-14)

**Fixed**
- Existing installs updating to v1.2.0 did not see the new ACE-Step XL SFT models enabled, and the music default stayed on Turbo. The curated default-model list is now versioned: entries added to it are merged into existing installs once (your own enable/disable choices are never overridden afterward), and installs still using the previous music default are moved to ACE-Step v1.5 XL SFT LM_4B with its recommended settings. Fresh installs were unaffected.

### v1.2.0 (2026-07-14)

**Added**
- **Light themes with a Dark / Light / Auto appearance mode.** Every theme family now has a daylight variant: Golden Hour pairs with warm paper and burnt orange, Classic with cool paper and blue, Onyx with light monochrome. Pick your style in Settings > System, then choose Dark, Light, or Auto; Auto follows your system's appearance and switches live when it changes. Warning banners, chips, gauges, and indicators were re-tuned to stay legible on light backgrounds, and video letterboxing stays dark on light themes to avoid glare.
- **ACE-Step v1.5 XL SFT, the premium music model.** The quality-focused CFG variant of the XL 4B DiT, now the default music model in Studio and Director (available with the 1.7B or 4B LM). Maestro implements the classifier-free guidance sampling path with Adaptive Projected Guidance this model requires, and unlocks the Steps and Guidance controls for it (defaults: 30 steps, guidance 7.0; raise steps toward 50 for maximum quality). This host downloads about 10 GB of weights if needed.

**Fixed**
- The fast ACE-Step LM decoder (vllm engine) was silently disabled on every Windows install by a faulty runtime check, forcing song planning onto a slow fallback decoder. Planning is dramatically faster after this fix.
- ACE-Step's tuned LM sampling defaults (temperature 0.85, top-p 0.9, LM guidance 2.5) never reached the UI, so generations ran at temperature 1.0. Advanced Settings now loads the recommended values when you select a model.
- Director music-video planning crashed with a connection error when two reference images had the same dimensions (a llama-server bug in batched image encoding), sometimes with a false "lower VRAM headroom?" popup on a nearly empty GPU. Both fixed, and the LLM server's output is now saved to logs/llm for future diagnosis.
- Songs sometimes showed only 30-40 seconds in the gallery until a manual browser refresh. Audio files are now written atomically so a partially written file can never be picked up or cached.
- Field edits persist as you type: a page refresh restores exactly what you last had in every field, including the lyrics prompt (which previously always reset) and cleared fields (which previously came back).
- New ACE-Step models were filed under Text to Speech instead of Music in the model lists.

### v1.1.3 (2026-07-12)

**Fixed**
- Director-mode clips no longer show a broken start-image icon in the gallery, the info bar, or the sidebar after a Load Settings pencil restore. Director keyframes live in the output workspace rather than the uploads folder; the thumbnail lookup now finds them there. Existing clips are fixed retroactively.
- Two-phase LoRA weights (for example 0.75 for stage 1 and 0.50 for the refine stage on LTX-2 models) no longer fail generation with "there should be at most 1 phases". The weights were always supported by the pipeline; only the validation rejected them.
- Director mode's LoRA selector now shows the correct green dot and safe-zone color for CivitAI-recommended weights on all themes. Golden Hour remapped its green to amber, making every LoRA look like it had guessed defaults.

### v1.1.2 (2026-07-12)

**Fixed**
- Director dashboard Re-join now actually works end to end: it uses the real clip concatenation (previously it called a function that didn't exist) and lays the original song over the rejoined video, the same way the pipeline's final output does.
- Regenerated clips come back at their full planned length. Reruns were silently split into multiple sliding windows by a legacy default and only the first ~5 seconds was kept, which shifted every later clip in the rejoin and broke lip sync. Reruns now always generate the clip as a single window and record the completed file.
- The media gallery refreshes when a rerun clip or rejoined video is saved, no browser reload needed.

### v1.1.1 (2026-07-12)

**Fixed**
- Director music videos: regenerating a clip from the Pipeline Dashboard now keeps the song. Reruns are conditioned on the exact segment of the soundtrack the clip covers, instead of the model inventing its own audio.
- Director dashboard: complete multi-clip runs no longer show a bogus "Generate N missing" count, and the Re-join button works (and reports errors instead of silently doing nothing). Existing saved pipelines are repaired automatically on load.
- ACE-Step 1.5 with the song LM appeared to hang forever with a runaway progress counter (for example 96761/97200 and climbing). The generation was actually progressing; the counter now reads honestly (token n of 600 for a 2 minute song).
- Performance Auto-Tune assigned audio a memory profile meant for large video models, which silently locked the ACE-Step song LM to a slow fallback decoder on every card under 24 GB VRAM. Audio now gets its own profile: cards with 12 GB+ unlock the fast LM engine. Re-run Auto-Tune (Settings > System > Auto card) after updating to pick this up.

### v1.1.0 (2026-07-10)

**Added**
- **Linked Model Folders** (Settings > System): reuse checkpoints and LoRAs from other installs such as Wan2GP, with one-click scanning of your Pinokio apps. Linked folders are strictly read-only; new downloads always go to Maestro's own folder. AI LoRA guides work for linked LoRAs too and are stored in Maestro's directory.
- **Krea 2 image models** (Raw and Turbo), ported from upstream Wan2GP.
- **10Eros v1.4** model entry with the author's abliterated Gemma text encoder and the reference workflow's per-stage LoRA strengths.
- **Reference Pipeline toggle** for 10Eros models (on by default): runs the model author's published ComfyUI workflow config (9+3 steps on hand-tuned sigmas, per-step CFG and STG, rectified-flow ancestral sampling).
- Version number in the UI header and this Updates section.

**Fixed**
- LTX-2 Dev and 10Eros models producing blurry, over-saturated output (a leaked `euler_ancestral` sampler setting; the root cause of the "Dev models look bad" reports).
- Reference pipeline dissolving the start image on image-to-video runs.
- The Load Settings pencil losing inference steps, guidance, STG scale, and CFG rescale values.
- Near-unreadable muted text across all three themes ([#7](https://github.com/Blizaine/Maestro/issues/7)).
- The STG slider was a no-op; it now engages STG on the correct transformer blocks.

**Improved**
- Downloaded models always show bright in the Enabled Models list; mode groups start collapsed.
- Model, LoRA, and recipe catalogs remain content-neutral and follow ordinary user-selected search and visibility controls.
- Deleting models can never touch files inside linked installs.

### v1.0.0 (2026-07-08)

Initial public release. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full feature rundown.

## Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **OS** | Windows 10/11 or Linux | Windows 11 |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA, 6 GB VRAM | NVIDIA RTX 3090 / 4090 / 5090, 24 GB+ VRAM |
| **System RAM** | 16 GB | 32 GB+ |
| **Disk space** | **150 GB free** | **500 GB free** (for full model collection) |
| **Python** | Auto-installed by Pinokio | — |

**What to expect by GPU** (rough ballpark — varies with model, resolution, and length):

| Your card | First run | A short clip after models are cached |
|---|---|---|
| **24 GB** (3090 / 4090 / 5090) | smooth — everything runs | ~1–3 min |
| **12–16 GB** (3060 12GB / 4070 / 4080) | good — auto-tune picks an offload profile | ~4–10 min |
| **6–8 GB** | works, but expect heavy offloading | slow; stick to short/low-res clips |

The first video is always the slow one: install is ~10–20 min, then the first generation on each model downloads its weights (the default video model is ~18 GB). After that, weights are cached and only generation time applies. Maestro's auto-tune sizes the settings to your card on first launch so you don't have to.

> ⚠ **AMD GPUs and macOS are not currently supported.** The pipeline depends on CUDA and several NVIDIA-only kernels. MacOS support is in development.  

> ⚠ **Model downloads are large.** A typical install pulls **50–100 GB** of model weights on first launch. The full collection can exceed **300 GB**. Make sure you have headroom on the drive where Pinokio is installed. However, only models requested during generation will be downloaded. 

## Install

1. Install [Pinokio](https://pinokio.computer).
2. In Pinokio, open the **Discover** tab and search for *Maestro* — or click the **Download** button on the [Maestro repo page](https://github.com/Blizaine/Maestro) and paste the URL.
3. Click **Install**. The launcher will:
   - Create a Python virtual environment in `app/env/`
   - Install all Python dependencies (torch, xformers, transformers, fastapi, …)
   - Install and revision-verify the official Blender MCP adapter plus a portable Blender 5.1 runtime
   - Build the React UI in `ui/`
4. When install finishes, click **Start**. If a generation needs model files that are not in the shared host cache, Maestro downloads them before loading the model into RAM/VRAM.

The install (without model downloads) typically takes **10–20 minutes** depending on internet speed. SAM 3.1 (used only for the experimental Inpaint feature) is **not installed by default** — install it on demand via Pinokio menu → "Install Inpaint Support (SAM 3.1)" if you want to use Inpaint.

### Updating

Click **Update** in the launcher menu. This pulls the latest launcher scripts and app code, reinstalls any new Python dependencies, refreshes pinned Blender/H3 acceleration runtimes, and rebuilds the React UI. At runtime, repositories with a declared safe version policy are checked by immutable revision and replaced only after validation; the official H3 style catalog uses the bounded daily metadata refresh described above.

### Resetting

Click **Reset** to wipe the install and start over. Removes `app/env/`, `ui/node_modules/`, `ui/dist/`, the pinned Blender MCP checkout, and the SAM venv if installed. Model checkpoints in `app/ckpts/` are NOT removed by default — delete them manually if you want a true fresh start.

### Continuing development work

Start with the durable [Maestro continuation guide](docs/operations/CONTINUATION.md)
and [fresh-thread handoff](docs/operations/FRESH_THREAD_HANDOFF.md) for the
current account, project-migration, credit, restart, and verification contracts.

Continuation is repository-rooted, not machine-path-rooted. Resolve the Git root
and require both `AGENTS.md` and `.beads/`; then perform the read-only activation
audit described in the continuation guide and inspect `.working` before editing.
This checkout's preserved historical SQLite tracker must not be initialized,
migrated, synced, hooked, or otherwise mutated. Preserve every pre-existing
dirty path and keep one writer per file or symbol cluster.

For coordinated restarts, use `app/scripts/restart_status.py` to set and show a
bounded public notice under one untracked generation value. Clear only that
exact generation after the intended local service is healthy and, when claimed,
the stable access surface has been exercised successfully; show the status once
more to confirm it. Never put operator secrets, private runtime identifiers, or
checkout-specific host paths in tracked files or logs.

Before handoff, run the full applicable tests and all CI-equivalent checks.
Report source/static, mocked, local-runtime, live-access, and human-acceptance
evidence separately. After the intended work is committed, perform
`git pull --rebase`, `git push`, and the final Git status serially; skip Beads
sync while the historical tracker is preserved.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the exact continuation, verification,
and closure procedure.

## Usage

After clicking **Start**, the launcher shows an **Open Web UI** button once the server is up.

- **Sidebar** — peer workspaces (Generate / Director / References), model picker, prompt, LoRAs, and advanced settings
- **Recipes** — open the bundled preset library from the empty Gallery or Generate sidebar; applying a recipe deliberately returns to Generate with editable settings and prompt
- **Main feed** — generated outputs, dashboard, Director pipeline status
- **Settings drawer** (gear icon) — model visibility, performance auto-tune, services (LLM, API keys, mature prompt guidance, theme)
- **Pinokio menu** — Update, Reset, Install Inpaint Support, LoRA folder shortcuts

## Optional support

Maestro can show the project's shared **Buy Me a Coffee** creator page, an optional **Patreon** page, and a public **Vast.ai compute sponsorship** option. Vast.ai compute sponsorship stays visibly locked until the sealed support ledger confirms at least $1,000 in net USD support from other sources after refunds and chargebacks. Once unlocked, it may link to an operator-configured public Vast.ai donation or account destination.

The Vast.ai option is not a payment processor, a dollar-to-credit exchange, or a promise of compute or service. Maestro does not infer a Vast.ai payment, create provider credentials, or automatically grant promotional Maestro credits from a direct-compute record. Owner-attested direct-compute records are limited to a one-time contribution and its refund/chargeback lifecycle. The initial record requires the recovery gate to be unlocked; later adjustments to that existing record remain available so the audit trail can stay truthful after a relock.

Other signed provider events or owner-verified records may grant recognition, bounded queue priority, early access, convenience features, and explicitly promotional Maestro credits under the server-owned benefit policy. These are thank-you benefits, not purchased compute, transferable value, a service guarantee, or expanded authority. Buy Me a Coffee remains the existing shared creator page; no second creator account is introduced.

Hosted credits are never a paywall. Fully funded work can receive bounded priority, while zero, partial, refunded, or expired allowance still creates an otherwise-valid durable job in the lowest ordinary queue band with starvation-bounded capacity. The sealed owner account and local/authenticated-LAN execution are exempt. Safe defaults are credit enforcement off and execution realm `local`.

The three operator-configured public links default to `disabled`. Enabling an option without a URL makes it truthfully `unconfigured`; a malformed or disallowed URL makes the catalog configuration fail closed. Only an enabled option with a valid URL is `available` and actionable, and the Vast.ai URL remains non-actionable until recovery is confirmed. Configure the links in Pinokio's per-app **Configure** tab:

```dotenv
MAESTRO_SUPPORT_BUY_ME_A_COFFEE_ENABLED=true
MAESTRO_SUPPORT_BUY_ME_A_COFFEE_URL=https://buymeacoffee.com/threadspan
MAESTRO_SUPPORT_PATREON_ENABLED=true
MAESTRO_SUPPORT_PATREON_URL=https://www.patreon.com/YOUR_PAGE
MAESTRO_SUPPORT_DIRECT_COMPUTE_SPONSORSHIP_ENABLED=true
MAESTRO_SUPPORT_DIRECT_COMPUTE_SPONSORSHIP_URL=https://cloud.vast.ai/
```

Buy Me a Coffee URLs must use exactly `buymeacoffee.com` or `www.buymeacoffee.com`; Patreon URLs must use exactly `patreon.com` or `www.patreon.com`; Vast.ai URLs must use exactly `vast.ai`, `www.vast.ai`, or `cloud.vast.ai`. Every URL must be at most 2,048 characters, use HTTPS, contain no credentials, whitespace, query string, fragment, control characters, or backslashes, and use no explicit port other than 443. Validation is syntactic and does not perform a DNS lookup or contact the destination. Keep account IDs and credentials out of tracked configuration and documentation.

As an alternative to environment values, create the ignored local file `app/settings/support.json` with this exact public-only schema:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "providers": {
    "buy_me_a_coffee": {
      "enabled": true,
      "support_url": "https://buymeacoffee.com/YOUR_PAGE"
    },
    "patreon": {
      "enabled": true,
      "support_url": "https://www.patreon.com/YOUR_PAGE"
    },
    "direct_compute_sponsorship": {
      "enabled": true,
      "support_url": "https://cloud.vast.ai/"
    }
  }
}
```

Only `enabled` and `support_url` are accepted for each provider; do not put credentials, webhook secrets, customer data, or payment metadata in this file. Environment values override the JSON file independently for each field. Maestro reloads the ignored JSON file for each catalog request, so saved file changes appear on the next refresh. Pinokio **Configure** changes normally require restarting Maestro so the process receives the updated environment.

## Remote and local-network sharing

Cloudflare sharing is enabled by default through `PINOKIO_SHARE_CLOUDFLARE=true`. After Maestro starts, the live URL appears both in Pinokio and as **Cloudflare · Copy link** in Maestro's top bar. With active account migration, visitors sign in and see only projects granted to their account; project creation binds the creator as owner without a project-password prompt. Before migration, the legacy project-password chooser remains available as a rollback-compatible access path.

When a verified stable Worker URL is active, Pinokio shows it as the primary Cloudflare address and also keeps the current direct `*.trycloudflare.com` Quick Tunnel visible as a separate copyable fallback. The direct URL bypasses the Worker proxy hop and remains available for Worker-quota or stable-route emergencies. If both sources report the same URL, Pinokio shows only one entry.

For a reusable address without buying a domain, Maestro includes a minimal Cloudflare Workers Free stable-share Worker in [`cloudflare/stable-share-worker`](cloudflare/stable-share-worker/README.md). It keeps Pinokio's existing Quick Tunnel and updates a canonical KV-stored target after each launch. KV may also contain one optional, bounded, expiring public restart-status record; it stores no secret or private state. Maestro displays the `*.workers.dev` address only after an authenticated update plus health/target verification at the updating edge; if that check fails, the current `*.trycloudflare.com` URL remains available. The default `SHARE_MODE=proxy` streams polling, uploads, downloads, and other HTTP traffic so the stable hostname survives page refreshes across Maestro restarts; `SHARE_MODE=redirect` is the configuration-only rollback. Proxying adds a Cloudflare Worker transit hop: bodies and session headers are not logged or stored, observability is disabled, and responses are `no-store`, but the traffic does pass through Cloudflare's Worker runtime. Cloudflare Free inbound requests are capped at 100 MB; that ceiling applies to the Worker and is also expected at the Quick Tunnel edge, so larger uploads require local/LAN access or a future chunked-upload path. The Workers Free allowance is 100,000 requests/day and 10 ms CPU/invocation. The landed remote idle cadence is 2,880 requests/day per visible tab and zero while hidden, below the 25,000/day enablement gate. Periodic upper bounds are 56,160/day for one continuously active remote job and 59,040/day for one running plus ten queued, before bounded event-driven refreshes. Multiple active tabs can still exhaust the allowance, so the independently surfaced Quick Tunnel remains the quota/extra-hop fallback. The Worker's `/direct` convenience route only works while the Worker is healthy; it is not usable after quota exhaustion. In proxy mode upstream redirects are never auto-followed, only same-target redirects are rewritten to the stable host, and cross-target redirects are rejected. Because Workers KV is eventually consistent across edge locations, another region can briefly retain the prior (normally expired) Quick Tunnel until KV converges. Keep the Worker update secret only in the ignored local `ENVIRONMENT`; the one-time Cloudflare provisioning credential is removed after setup. Do not enable a paid Workers plan for this setup.

Remote access is deliberately not a machine-administration surface. It exposes the app but denies Classic UI, system/storage/model-source settings, arbitrary model links/paths, and service load/unload. In active migration state, sealed account membership authorizes project access across direct, LAN, and Cloudflare surfaces; project-password unlock, relock, and password-management routes are not part of that experience. The legacy browser grant cache remains only for accounts-off or incomplete-migration rollback compatibility. LAN binding remains disabled by default.

### Optional host accounts

Host accounts are disabled by default. Maestro ships no default account or password, and passkey authentication is not available. Enabling accounts does not activate any external provider. After the explicit zero-quarantine existing-project migration becomes active, sealed account membership replaces project passwords as the project authorization boundary.

To create the first owner account:

1. In Pinokio's per-app **Configure** tab, set `MAESTRO_ACCOUNTS_ENABLED=true` and `MAESTRO_ACCOUNT_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED=true`, then restart Maestro.
2. Open Maestro through its direct local loopback Web UI, open **Support**, select the **Account** tab, and create the first owner. Bootstrap is not offered through LAN or Cloudflare access.
3. Save the one-time recovery codes offline before dismissing them. Do not place passwords, recovery codes, account-store data, or signing secrets in the repository or `ENVIRONMENT` files.
4. Set `MAESTRO_ACCOUNT_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED=false` and restart Maestro again. Leave `MAESTRO_ACCOUNTS_ENABLED=true` to keep sign-in and existing accounts available.

Explicitly setting either flag is preserved by later installs and updates. A partial configuration receives only the missing safe default; existing values are not rewritten.

After the first owner is created, Maestro records bootstrap completion beside the account store. Deleting only the account store does not reopen owner setup while the sibling `.bootstrap-complete` marker remains. Prefer restoring a known-good backup. If a deliberate full account reset is unavoidable, stop Maestro first, then remove both the account store and its sibling `.bootstrap-complete` marker. Remove the session secret only when you also intend to invalidate all sealed account state, then re-enable bootstrap and perform owner setup again through the direct local loopback Web UI. This destructive reset removes account sessions and recovery state; there is no automatic reset or CLI for it. Never put credentials, recovery codes, or secret values in commands or logs.

Lawful-use, separately licensed Ref2VA, and applicable BFL/Krea model-license notices are versioned once per Maestro host, not per browser, project, or device. Any currently authorized project member, or a legacy password-authorized user before migration, may record the exact displayed version; doing so grants no project or machine-control capability. A notice version change requires a fresh acceptance, and any required manual-review commitment is user-confirmed before the selected model or paired recipe can run. Mature prompt guidance is a separate host setting and is applied only when the current Generate or Director job is explicitly marked **Explicit**. Maestro does not inspect local prompts or outputs to make that choice. External LLM providers remain separately disclosed and subject to their own terms and privacy policies.

Maestro respects Pinokio's `PINOKIO_SHARE_LOCAL` environment variable. Set it to `false` (in the per-app or global ENVIRONMENT file) to bind the server to loopback only; set to `true` for LAN access. Pinokio's own daemon proxy is a separate concern that may also need to honor the variable depending on your setup.

## API examples

The React UI uses the same project-scoped API. In active migration state, sign in first; the signed `maestro_account_session` cookie identifies the account session while the server validates sealed project membership on every request. The legacy `maestro_session` project-grant cookie applies only before account migration is active.

```bash
# Resolve whichever surface is active. Default proxy mode remains on the stable
# Worker; explicit redirect rollback resolves to the current Quick Tunnel.
STABLE='https://YOUR-WORKER.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev'
EFFECTIVE=$(curl -fsS -L -c cookies.txt -o /dev/null -w '%{url_effective}' \
  "$STABLE/api/v1/access-context")
BASE=${EFFECTIVE%/api/v1/access-context}

# Discover access capabilities without exposing host paths or secrets
curl -fsS -b cookies.txt "$BASE/api/v1/access-context"

# After signing in through the account UI, list only an account-authorized
# project's final outputs. The browser session cookie is revocable server state.
curl -fsS -b cookies.txt "$BASE/api/v1/outputs?workspace=my-project&artifact_scope=final"

# Create and animate a bounded Blender scene; no Python/code field is accepted
curl -fsS -b cookies.txt -H "Origin: $BASE" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"workspace":"my-project","clear_scene":true,"objects":[{"name":"Block","primitive":"cube","location":[0,0,0]}]}' \
  "$BASE/api/v1/blender/scene"
curl -fsS -b cookies.txt -H "Origin: $BASE" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"workspace":"my-project","frame_start":0,"frame_end":240,"objects":[{"name":"Block","keyframes":[{"frame":0,"location":[0,0,0]},{"frame":240,"location":[4,0,0]}]}]}' \
  "$BASE/api/v1/blender/animate"
```

Python and JavaScript clients use the same JSON bodies with their normal cookie-aware HTTP client (`requests.Session` or `fetch(..., {credentials: 'include'})`). Blender preview sampling is `POST /api/v1/blender/render` with `frames` containing 2–32 integers; previews are stamped with project/privacy metadata and registered as project reference candidates by default.

## License

Maestro is released under the **WanGP Non-Commercial Evaluation License 1.1**, inherited from the upstream Wan2GP project. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the summary and [app/LICENSE.txt](app/LICENSE.txt) for the full text.

**TL;DR**: free to use and modify for non-commercial purposes; the *outputs* you generate are yours to use commercially (with attribution); commercial use of the *software itself* (including hosted services and APIs) requires a separate commercial license from the WanGP licensor.

Third-party models, weights, and components keep their own licenses — review them before redistributing. MiniMax H3 weights remain subject to MiniMax's separate model terms and any authorization or waiver required for the user's location. Notably, the [seed-vc](https://github.com/Plachta/seed-vc) voice-conversion component is **GPL-3.0**, so it is distributed from its own repository ([Blizaine/maestro-seedvc](https://github.com/Blizaine/maestro-seedvc)) and cloned into `app/postprocessing/seedvc/` at install time rather than shipped in this tree. Other vendored components include BigVGAN (MIT), FlashVSR sparse-sage (Apache-2.0), and IndexTTS2 (bilibili model license).
